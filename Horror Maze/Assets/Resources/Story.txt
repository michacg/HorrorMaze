Where is she ?
What did I . . . do ?
It burns . . . my throat , my eyes , everything . . . is this how she felt . . . ?
I can't . . . breathe in here . . .
The smoke is suffocating . . .
These walls . . . I've been here before .
Is this hell . . . ? If it is . . . it's what I deserve , after all .
Where are you !? Let me save you !
I couldn't save her . Again .
I belong here . I don't deserve peace .
I don't care if I wander here forever . . . if it means I can save her . . .
Don't leave me alone . . . please . Don't leave me alone !
Her favorite toy . . . what was it again . . . ?
Is this God punishing me for what I did ?
After all my years of training , and I couldn't even save her . Just like before . . . I couldn't save her either .
I shouldn't have thrown it in the fire back then . . . I'm sorry ! I'm so sorry !
Come back , please . . .
It hurts .
I only allowed myself to live because I thought I could save others like you . But now . . . yes , this hell is where I belong .
An eternity of searching . . . how fitting .
I couldn't save you , I couldn't save her . . . I don't even deserve to save myself .
If there's a god , they're surely punishing me for what I did to you .
Our family was never the same after that night . How could I . . .
I didn't mean to , I'm so sorry . I'm so sorry . . . !
I was never the favorite daughter . . .
Mom always loved you more . She was right to . . .
Dad wouldn't even bother beating me anymore after what I did . . .
I've watched myself turn to ash , over and over . . . is this my punishment ?
They trusted me to save them . I'm supposed to save lives yet . . .
People trust us to save their loved ones . . . how could I . . . ?
She was playing too , when it happened . How did I miss it . . .
I'm a coward .
All those years ago . . . you've hated me all this time , haven't you ?
Is this your revenge . . . ?
I ran away that night .
Back then . . . how could I do that to your favorite toy . . .
They said the girl was just around your age too . . . how could I not find her . . . ?
