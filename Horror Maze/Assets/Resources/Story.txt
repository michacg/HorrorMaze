Where is she ?
Where are you ? !
Let me save you !
Don't leave me alone . . . please . Don't leave me alone !
Come back , please . . .
I can't . . . breathe in here . . .
It hurts .
It burns . . . my throat , my eyes , everything . . . is this how you felt . . . ?
I don't care if I wander here forever . . . if it means I can save you . . .
I was never the favorite daughter . . .
What did I . . . do ?
I ran away that night .
Your favorite toy . . . what was it again . . . ?
How could I do that to your doll . . .
I didn't mean to , I'm so sorry . I'm so sorry . . . !
I've watched myself turn to ash , over and over . . . is this my punishment ?
Is this your revenge . . . ?
Is this hell . . . ?
An eternity of searching . . . how fitting .
I belong here . I don't deserve peace .
